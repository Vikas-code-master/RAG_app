Men with negative minds told F. W. Woolworth, he would go "broke"  
trying to run a store on five and ten cent sales. He did not believe them. He knew  
that he could do anything, within reason, if he backed his plans with faith.  
Exercising his right to keep other men's negative suggestions out of his mind, he
