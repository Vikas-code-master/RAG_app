13. LACK OF A WELL DEFINED POWER OF DECISION.  
Men who succeed reach decisions promptly, and change them, if at  
all, very slowly. Men who fail, reach decisions, if at all, very slowly,  
and change them frequently, and quickly. Indecision and  
procrastination are twin brothers. Where one is found, the other  
may usually be found also. Kill off this pair before they completely  
"hog-tie" you to the treadmill of FAILURE. 
14. ONE OR MORE OF THE SIX BASIC FEARS. These fears  
have been analyzed for you in a later chapter. They must be  
mastered before you can market your services effectively. 
15. WRONG SELECTION OF A MATE IN MARRIAGE. This  
a most common cause of failure. The relationship of marriage  
brings people intimately into contact. Unless this relationship is  
harmonious, failure is likely to follow. Moreover, it will be a form  
of failure that is marked by misery and unhappiness, destroying all  
signs of AMBITION. 
16. OVER-CAUTION. The person who takes no chances,  
generally has to take whatever is left when others are through  
choosing. Over-caution is as bad as under-caution. Both are  
extremes to be guarded against. Life itself is filled with the element  
of chance. 
17. WRONG SELECTION OF ASSOCIATES IN BUSINESS.  
This is one of the most common causes of failure in business. In  
marketing personal services, one should use great care to select an  
employer who will be an inspiration, and who is, himself,  
intelligent and successful. We emulate those with whom we  
associate most closely. Pick an employer who is worth emulating. 
18. SUPERSTITION AND PREJUDICE. Superstition is a  
form of fear. It is also a sign of ignorance. Men who succeed keep  
open minds and are afraid of nothing. 
19. WRONG SELECTION OF A VOCATION. No man can  
succeed in a line of endeavor which he does not like. The most  
essential step in the marketing of personal services is that of  
selecting an occupation into which you can throw yourself  
wholeheartedly.
