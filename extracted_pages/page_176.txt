  THINK & GROW RICH   
Poverty and riches often change places. The Crash taught the world this  
truth, although the world will not long remember the lesson. Poverty may, and  
generally does, voluntarily take the place of riches. When riches take the place of  
poverty, the change is usually brought about through well conceived and  
carefully executed PLANS. Poverty needs no plan. It needs no one to aid it,  
because it is bold and ruthless. Riches are shy and timid. They have to be  
"attracted." 
ANYBODY can WISH 
for riches, and most
people do, but only a few
know that a definite plan,
plus a BURNING DESIRE 
for wealth, are the only
dependable means of
accumulating wealth.
