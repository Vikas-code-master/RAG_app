7. UNFAVORABLE ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES  
DURING CHILDHOOD. "As the twig is bent, so shall the tree  
grow." Most people who have criminal tendencies acquire them as  
the result of bad environment, and improper associates during  
childhood. 
8. PROCRASTINATION. This is one of the most common  
causes of failure. "Old Man Procrastination" stands within the  
shadow of every human being, waiting his opportunity to spoil  
one's chances of success. Most of us go through life as failures,  
because we are waiting for the "time to be right" to start doing  
something worthwhile. Do not wait. The time will never be "just  
right." Start where you stand, and work with whatever tools you  
may have at your command, and better tools will be found as you  
go along.
9. LACK OF PERSISTENCE. Most of us are good "starters"  
but poor "finishers" of everything we begin. Moreover, people are  
prone to give up at the first signs of defeat. There is no substitute  
for PERSISTENCE. The person who makes PERSISTENCE his  
watch-word, discovers that "Old Man Failure" finally becomes  
tired, and makes his departure. Failure cannot cope with  
PERSISTENCE. 
10. NEGATIVE PERSONALITY. There is no hope of success  
for the person who repels people through a negative personality.  
Success comes through the application of POWER, and power is  
attained through the cooperative efforts of other people. A negative  
personality will not induce cooperation.
11. LACK OF CONTROLLED SEXUAL URGE. Sex energy is  
the most powerful of all the stimuli which move people into  
ACTION. Because it is the most powerful of the emotions, it must  
be controlled, through transmutation, and converted into other  
channels.
12. UNCONTROLLED DESIRE FOR "SOMETHING FOR  
NOTHING." The gambling instinct drives millions of people to  
failure. Evidence of this may be found in a study of the Wall Street  
crash of '29, during which millions of people tried to make money  
by gambling on stock margins.
