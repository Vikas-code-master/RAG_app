CHAPTER 7
ORGANIZED PLANNING
THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF DESIRE INTO ACTION
The Sixth Step toward Riches
You have learned that everything man creates or acquires, begins in the  
form of DESIRE, that desire is taken on the first lap of its journey, from the  
abstract to the concrete, into the workshop of the IMAGINATION, where PLANS  
for its transition are created and organized.
In Chapter two, you were instructed to take six definite, practical steps, as  
your first move in translating the desire for money into its monetary equivalent.  
One of these steps is the formation of a DEFINITE, practical plan, or plans,  
through which this transformation may be made. You will now be instructed  
how to build plans which will be practical, viz:— 
(a) Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for the  
creation, and carrying out of your plan, or plans for the accumulation of money
— making use of the "Master Mind" principle described in a later chapter.  
(Compliance with this instruction is absolutely essential. Do not neglect it.)
(b) Before forming your "Master Mind" alliance, decide what advantages,  
and benefits, you may offer the individual members of your group, in return for  
their cooperation. No one will work indefinitely without some form of  
compensation. No intelligent person will either request or expect another to  
work without adequate compensation, although this may not always be in the  
form of money.
(c) Arrange to meet with the members of your "Master Mind" group at  
least twice a week, and more often if possible, until you have jointly perfected  
the necessary plan, or plans for the accumulation of money.
