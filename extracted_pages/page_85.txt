subject which assumes the proportion of a tragedy with millions of men and  
women whose sole source of income is personal services.
The answer is, "DOING A THING WELL NEVER IS TROUBLE! THE  
PLAN PREPARED BY THIS WOMAN FOR THE BENEFIT OF HER SON,  
HELPED HIM GET THE JOB FOR WHICH HE APPLIED, AT THE FIRST  
INTERVIEW, AT A SALARY FIXED BY HIMSELF." 
Moreover— and this, too, is important— THE POSITION DID NOT  
REQUIRE THE YOUNG MAN TO START AT THE BOTTOM. HE BEGAN AS A  
JUNIOR EXECUTIVE, AT AN EXECUTIVE'S SALARY. 
"Why go to all this trouble?" do you ask? 
Well, for one thing, the PLANNED PRESENTATION of this young man's  
application for a position clipped off no less than ten years of time he would  
have required to get to where he began, had he "started at the bottom and  
worked his way up." 
This idea of starting at the bottom and working one's way up may appear  
to be sound, but the major objection to it is this— too many of those who begin at  
the bottom never manage to lift their heads high enough to be seen by  
OPPORTUNITY, so they remain at the bottom. It should be remembered, also,  
that the outlook from the bottom is not so very bright or encouraging. It has a  
tendency to kill off ambition. We call it "getting into a rut," which means that we  
accept our fate because we form the HABIT of daily routine, a habit that finally  
becomes so strong we cease to try to throw it off. And that is another reason why  
it pays to start one or two steps above the bottom. By so doing one forms the  
HABIT of looking around, of observing how others get ahead, of seeing  
OPPORTUNITY, and of embracing it without hesitation.
Dan Halpin is a splendid example of what I mean. During his college  
days, he was manager of the famous 1930 National Championship Notre Dame  
football team, when it was under the direction of the late Knute Rockne.
Perhaps he was inspired by the great football coach to aim high, and NOT  
MISTAKE TEMPORARY DEFEAT FOR FAILURE, just as Andrew Carnegie, the  
great industrial leader, inspired his young business lieutenants to set high goals  
for themselves. At any rate, young Halpin finished college at a mighty  
unfavorable time, when the depression had made jobs scarce, so, after a fling at  
investment banking and motion pictures, he took the first opening with a  
potential future he could find— selling electrical hearing aids on a commission  
basis. ANYONE COULD START IN THAT SORT OF JOB, AND HALPIN KNEW  
IT, but it was enough to open the door of opportunity to him.
