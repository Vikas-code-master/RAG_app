  THINK & GROW RICH   
a. FOOD. Next to freedom of thought and deed comes FOOD,  
CLOTHING, and SHELTER, the three basic necessities of life. 
Because of our universal freedom the average American family has  
available, at its very door, the choicest selection of food to be found  
anywhere in the world, and at prices within its financial range.
A family of two, living in the heart of Times Square district of New  
York City, far removed from the source of production of foods, took  
careful inventory of the cost of a simple breakfast, with this astonishing  
result: 
Articles of food; Cost at the breakfast table: 
Grape Fruit Juice, (From Florida) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  . 02 
Rippled Wheat Breakfast food (Kansas Farm). . . . . . . . . 02

It is not very difficult to obtain FOOD in a country where two people can  
have breakfast consisting of all they want or need for a dime apiece! Observe that  
this simple breakfast was gathered, by some strange form of magic (?) from  
China, South America, Utah, Kansas and the New England States, and delivered  
on the breakfast table, ready for consumption, in the very heart of the most  
crowded city in America, at a cost well within the means of the most humble  
laborer. 
The cost included all federal, state and city taxes! (Here is a fact the  
politicians did not mention when they were crying out to the voters to throw  
their opponents out of office because the people were being taxed to death). 
b. SHELTER. This family lives in a comfortable apartment, heated  
by steam, lighted with electricity, with gas for cooking, all for $65.00 a  
month. In a smaller city, or a more sparsely settled part of New York city,  
the same apartment could be had for as low as $20.00 a month.
