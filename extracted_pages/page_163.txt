  THINK & GROW RICH   
Marie Dressler found herself down and out, with her money gone, with  
no job, when she was about sixty. She, too, went after the "breaks," and got them.  
Her PERSISTENCE brought an astounding triumph late in life, long beyond the  
age when most men and women are done with ambition to achieve. 
Eddie Cantor lost his money in the 1929 stock crash, but he still had his  
PERSISTENCE and his courage. With these, plus two prominent eyes, he  
exploited himself back into an income of $10,000 a week! Verily, if one has  
PERSISTENCE, one can get along very well without many other qualities.
The only "break" anyone can afford to rely upon is a self-made "break."  
These come through the application of PERSISTENCE. The starting point is  
DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE.
Examine the first hundred people you meet, ask them what they want  
most in life, and ninety eight of them will not be able to tell you. If you press  
them for an answer, some will say— SECURITY, many will say— MONEY, a few  
will say— HAPPINESS, others will say— FAME AND POWER, and still others  
will say— SOCIAL RECOGNITION, EASE IN LIVING, ABILITY TO SING,  
DANCE, or WRITE, but none of them will be able to define these terms, or give  
the slightest indication of a PLAN by which they hope to attain these vaguely  
expressed wishes. Riches do not respond to wishes. They respond only to  
definite plans, backed by definite desires, through constant PERSISTENCE. 
HOW TO DEVELOP PERSISTENCE
There are four simple steps which lead to the habit of PERSISTENCE.  
They call for no great amount of intelligence, no particular amount of education,  
and but little time or effort. The necessary steps are:— 
1. A DEFINITE PURPOSE BACKED BY BURNING DESIRE  
FOR ITS FULFILLMENT. 
2. A DEFINITE PLAN, EXPRESSED IN CONTINUOUS  
ACTION. 
3. A MIND CLOSED TIGHTLY AGAINST ALL NEGATIVE  
AND DISCOURAGING INFLUENCES, including negative  
suggestions of relatives, friends and acquaintances.
4. A FRIENDLY ALLIANCE WITH ONE OR MORE  
PERSONS WHO WILL ENCOURAGE ONE TO FOLLOW  
THROUGH WITH BOTH PLAN AND PURPOSE.
