  THINK & GROW RICH   
For six years, from 1929, to 1935, the people of America, both rich and  
poor, barely missed seeing the Old Man Economics hand over to the sheriff all  
the businesses, and industries and banks. It was not a pretty sight! It did not  
increase our respect for mob psychology through which men cast reason to the  
winds and start trying to GET without GIVING. 
We who went through those six discouraging years, when FEAR WAS IN  
THE SADDLE, AND FAITH WAS ON THE GROUND, cannot forget how  
ruthlessly the LAW OF ECONOMICS exacted its toll from both rich and poor,  
weak and strong, old and young. We shall not wish to go through another such  
experience. 
These observations are not founded upon short-time experience. They are  
the result of twenty-five years of careful analysis of the methods of both the most  
successful and the most unsuccessful men America has known.
