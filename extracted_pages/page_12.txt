  THINK & GROW RICH   
Money and material things are essential for freedom of body and mind,  
but there are some who will feel that the greatest of all riches can be evaluated  
only in terms of lasting friendships, harmonious family relationships, sympathy  
and understanding between business associates, and introspective harmony  
which brings one peace of mind measurable only in spiritual values!
All who read, understand and apply this philosophy will be better  
prepared to attract and enjoy these higher estates which always have been and  
always will be denied to all except those who are ready for them.
Be prepared, therefore, when you expose yourself to the influence of this  
philosophy, to experience a CHANGED LIFE which may help you not only to  
negotiate your way through life with harmony and understanding, but also to  
prepare you for the accumulation of material riches in abundance.
