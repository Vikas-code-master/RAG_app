  THINK & GROW RICH   
The following are important factors of leadership:— 
1. UNWAVERING COURAGE based upon knowledge of self, and of one's  
occupation. No follower wishes to be dominated by a leader who lacks self-
confidence and courage. No intelligent follower will be dominated by such a  
leader very long. 
2. SELF-CONTROL. The man who cannot control himself, can never  
control others. Self-control sets a mighty example for one's followers, which the  
more intelligent will emulate.
3. A KEEN SENSE OF JUSTICE. Without a sense of fairness and justice, no  
leader can command and retain the respect of his followers. 
4. DEFINITENESS OF DECISION. The man who wavers in his decisions,  
shows that he is not sure of himself. He cannot lead others successfully.
5. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. The successful leader must plan his work,  
and work his plan. A leader who moves by guesswork, without practical, definite  
plans, is comparable to a ship without a rudder. Sooner or later he will land on  
the rocks. 
6. THE HABIT OF DOING MORE THAN PAID FOR. One of the penalties  
of leadership is the necessity of willingness, upon the part of the leader, to do  
more than he requires of his followers. 
7. A PLEASING PERSONALITY. No slovenly, careless person can become  
a successful leader. Leadership calls for respect. Followers will not respect a  
leader who does not grade high on all of the factors of a Pleasing Personality. 
8. SYMPATHY AND UNDERSTANDING. The successful leader must be  
in sympathy with his followers. Moreover, he must understand them and their  
problems.
9. MASTERY OF DETAIL. Successful leadership calls for mastery of  
details of the leader's position.
