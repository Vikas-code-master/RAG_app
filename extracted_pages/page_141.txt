PERSON THE OPPORTUNITY TO RENDER USEFUL SERVICE, AND TO  
COLLECT RICHES IN PROPORTION TO THE VALUE OF THE SERVICE. 
The "System" denies no one this right, but it does not, and cannot promise  
SOMETHING FOR NOTHING, because the system, itself, is irrevocably  
controlled by the LAW OF ECONOMICS which neither recognizes nor tolerates  
for long, GETTING WITHOUT GIVING. 
The LAW OF ECONOMICS was passed by Nature! There is no Supreme  
Court to which violators of this law may appeal. The law hands out both  
penalties for its violation, and appropriate rewards for its observance, without  
interference or the possibility of interference by any human being. The law  
cannot be repealed. It is as fixed as the stars in the heavens, and subject to, and a  
part of the same system that controls the stars. 
May one refuse to adapt one's self to the LAW OF ECONOMICS? 
Certainly! This is a free country, where all men are born with equal rights,  
including the privilege of ignoring the LAW OF ECONOMICS. 
What happens then? 
Well, nothing happens until large numbers of men join forces for the  
avowed purpose of ignoring the law, and taking what they want by force. 
THEN COMES THE DICTATOR, WITH WELL ORGANIZED FIRING  
SQUADS AND MACHINE GUNS! 
We have not yet reached that stage in America! But we have heard all we  
want to know about how the system works. Perhaps we hal1 be fortunate  
enough not to demand personal knowledge of so gruesome a reality. Doubtless  
we shall prefer to continue with our FREEDOM OF SPEECH, FREEDOM OF  
DEED, and FREEDOM TO RENDER USEFUL SERVICE IN RETURN FOR  
RICHES. 
The practice, by Government officials of extending to men and women the  
privilege of raiding the public treasury in return for votes, sometimes results in  
election, but as night follows day, the final payoff comes; when every penny  
wrongfully used, must be repaid with compound interest on compound interest.  
If those who make the grab are not forced to repay, the burden falls on their  
children, and their children's children, "even unto the third and fourth  
generations." There is no way to avoid the debt.
Men can, and sometimes do, form themselves into groups for the purpose  
of crowding wages up, and working hours down. There is a point beyond which  
they cannot go. It is the point at which the LAW OF ECONOMICS steps in, and  
the sheriff gets both the employer and the employees.
