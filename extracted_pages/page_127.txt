  THINK & GROW RICH   
20. LACK OF CONCENTRATION OF EFFORT. The "jack-of-
all-trades" seldom is good at any. Concentrate all of your efforts on  
one DEFINITE CHIEF AIM. 
21. THE HABIT OF INDISCRIMINATE SPENDING. The  
spend-thrift cannot succeed, mainly because he stands eternally in  
FEAR OF POVERTY. Form the habit of systematic saving by  
putting aside a definite percentage of your income. Money in the  
bank gives one a very safe foundation of COURAGE when bar-
gaining for the sale of personal services. Without money, one must  
take what one is offered, and be glad to get it. 
22. LACK OF ENTHUSIASM. Without enthusiasm one  
cannot be convincing. Moreover, enthusiasm is contagious, and the  
person who has it, under control, is generally welcome in any  
group of people.
23. INTOLERANCE. The person with a "closed" mmd on  
any subject seldom gets ahead. Intolerance means that one has  
stopped acquiring knowledge. The most damaging forms of  
intolerance are those connected with religious, racial, and political  
differences of opinion.
24. INTEMPERANCE. The most damaging forms of  
intemperance are connected with eating, strong drink, and sexual  
activities. Overindulgence in any of these is fatal to success. 
25. INABILITY TO COOPERATE WITH OTHERS. More  
people lose their positions and their big opportunities in life,  
because of this fault, than for all other reasons combined. It is a  
fault which no well-informed business man, or leader will tolerate. 
26. POSSESSION OF POWER THAT WAS NOT ACQUIRED  
THROUGH SELF EFFORT. (Sons and daughters of wealthy men,  
and others who inherit money which they did not earn). Power in  
the hands of one who did not acquire it gradually, is often fatal to  
success. QUICK RICHES are more dangerous than poverty. 
27. INTENTIONAL DISHONESTY. There is no substitute for  
honesty. One may be temporarily dishonest by force of  
circumstances over which one has no control, without permanent  
damage. But, there is NO HOPE for the person who is dishonest by  
choice. Sooner or later, his deeds will catch up with him, and he  
will pay by loss of reputation, and perhaps even loss of liberty.
