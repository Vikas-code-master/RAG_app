  THINK & GROW RICH   
As a final word of preparation, before you begin the first chapter, may I  
offer one brief suggestion which may provide a clue by which the Carnegie  
secret may be recognized? It is this— ALL ACHIEVEMENT, ALL EARNED  
RICHES, HAVE THEIR BEGINNING IN AN IDEA!  If you are ready for the secret,  
you already possess one half of it, therefore, you will readily recognize the other  
half the moment it reaches your mind.
