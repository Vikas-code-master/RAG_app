POVERTY is attracted to the one whose mind is favorable to it, as money  
is attracted to him whose mind has been deliberately prepared to attract it, and  
through the same laws. POVERTY CONSCIOUSNESS WILL VOLUNTARILY  
SEIZE THE MIND WHICH IS NOT OCCUPIED WITH THE MONEY  
CONSCIOUSNESS. A poverty consciousness develops without conscious  
application of habits favorable to it. The money consciousness must be created to  
order, unless one is born with such a consciousness.
Catch the full significance of the statements in the preceding paragraph,  
and you will understand the importance of PERSISTENCE in the accumulation  
of a fortune. Without PERSISTENCE, you will be defeated, even before you start.  
With PERSISTENCE you will win. 
If you have ever experienced a nightmare, you will realize the value of  
persistence. You are lying in bed, half awake, with a feeling that you are about to  
smother. You are unable to turn over, or to move a muscle. You realize that you  
MUST BEGIN to regain control over your muscles. Through persistent effort of

If you select your "Master Mind" group with care, you will have in it, at  
least one person who will aid you in the development of PERSISTENCE. Some  
men who have accumulated great fortunes, did so because of NECESSITY. They  
developed the habit of PERSISTENCE, because they were so closely driven by  
circumstances, that they had to become persistent. 
THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR PERSISTENCE! It cannot be supplanted  
by any other quality! Remember this, and it will hearten you, in the beginning,  
when the going may seem difficult and slow.
Those who have cultivated the HABIT of persistence seem to enjoy  
insurance against failure. No matter how many times they are defeated, they  
finally arrive up toward the top of the ladder. Sometimes it appears that there is
