  THINK & GROW RICH   
Just as electricity will turn the wheels of industry, and render useful  
service if used constructively; or snuff out life if wrongly used, so will the law of  
auto-suggestion lead you to peace and prosperity, or down into the valley of  
misery, failure, and death, according to your degree of understanding and  
application of it. 
If you fill your mind with FEAR, doubt and unbelief in your ability to  
connect with, and use the forces of Infinite Intelligence, the law of auto—  
suggestion will take this spirit of unbelief and use it as a pattern by which your  
subconscious mind will translate it into its physical equivalent. 
THIS STATEMENT IS AS TRUE AS THE STATEMENT THAT TWO AND  
TWO ARE FOUR! 
Like the wind which carries one ship East, and another West, the law of  
auto-suggestion will lift you up or pull you down, according to the way you set  
your sails of THOUGHT. The law of auto-suggestion, through which any person  
may rise to altitudes of achievement which stagger the imagination, is well  
described in the following verse: 
"If you think you are beaten, you are,
If you think you dare not, you don't 
If you like to win, but you think you can't,
It is almost certain you won't. 
.
"If you think you'll lose, you're lost 
For out of the world we find, 
Success begins with a fellow's will— 
It's all in the state of mind. 
.
"If you think you are outclassed, you are, 
You've got to think high to rise, 
You've got to be sure of yourself before
You can ever win a prize. 
.
"Life's battles don't always go 
To the stronger or faster man,
But soon or late the man who wins
Is the man WHO THINKS HE CAN!"
