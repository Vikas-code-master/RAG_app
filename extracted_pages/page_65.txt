"' Do you think you can persuade Andrew Carnegie to sell? ' he asked. 
"' I can try, ' said Schwab.
"' If you can get him to sell, I will undertake the matter, ' said Morgan.
"So far so good. But would Carnegie sell? How much would he demand?  
(Schwab thought about $320,000,000). What would he take payment in? Common  
or preferred stocks? Bonds? Cash? Nobody could raise a third of a billion dollars  
in cash.
"There was a golf game in January on the frost-cracking heath of the St.  
Andrews links in Westchester, with Andrew bundled up in sweaters against the  
cold, and Charlie talking volubly, as usual, to keep his spirits up. But no word of  
business was mentioned until the pair sat down in the cozy warmth of the  
Carnegie cottage hard by. Then, with the same persuasiveness that had  
hypnotized eighty millionaires at the University Club, Schwab poured out the  
glittering promises of retirement in comfort, of untold millions to satisfy the old  
man's social caprices. Carnegie capitulated, wrote a figure on a slip of paper,  
handed it to Schwab and said, 'all right, that's what we'll sell for.'
"The figure was approximately $400,000,000, and was reached by taking  
the $320,000,000 mentioned by Schwab as a basic figure, and adding to it  
$80,000,000 to represent the increased capital value over the previous two years.
"Later, on the deck of a trans-Atlantic liner, the Scotsman said ruefully to  
Morgan, 'I wish I had asked you for $100,000,000 more.'
"' If you had asked for it, you'd have gotten it, ' Morgan told him  
cheerfully.

"There was an uproar, of course. A British correspondent cabled that the  
foreign steel world was 'appalled' by the gigantic combination. President Hadley,  
of Yale, declared that unless trusts were regulated the country might expect 'an  
emperor in Washington within the next twenty-five years. ' But that able stock  
manipulator, Keene, went at his work of shoving the new stock at the public so  
vigorously that all the excess water— estimated by some at nearly $600,000,000—  
was absorbed in a twinkling. So Carnegie had his millions, and the Morgan  
syndicate had $62,000,000 for all its 'trouble, ' and all the 'boys, ' from Gates to  
Gary, had their millions.
