"FIFTY-SEVEN" FAMOUS ALIBIS
By Old Man IF
People who do not succeed have one distinguishing trait in common. They  
know all the reasons for failure , and have what they believe to be air-tight alibis to  
explain away their own lack of achievement.
Some of these alibis are clever, and a few of them are justifiable by the  
facts. But alibis cannot be used for money. The world wants to know only one  
thing—HAVE YOU ACHIEVED SUCCESS? 
A character analyst compiled a list of the most commonly used alibis. As  
you read the list, examine yourself carefully, and determine how many of these  
alibis, if any, are your own property. Remember, too, the philosophy presented  
in this book makes every one of these alibis obsolete.
