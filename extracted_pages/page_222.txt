THE SIX BASIC FEARS
There are six basic fears, with some combination of which every human  
suffers at one tune or another. Most people are fortunate if they do not suffer  
from the entire six. Named in the order of their most common appearance, they  
are:— 
The fear of POVERTY } at the bottom of
The fear of CRITICISM } most of one's 
The fear of ILL HEALTH } worries 
The fear of LOSS OF LOVE OF SOMEONE

contact hundreds of people, daily, who were suffering from such contagious  
diseases as small-pox, without becoming infected. Their immunity against the  
disease consisted, largely, if not solely, in their absolute lack of FEAR.

impulse of thought. Following this statement, comes another of still greater  
importance, namely, MAN'S THOUGHT IMPULSES BEGIN IMMEDIATELY TO  
TRANSLATE THEMSELVES INTO THEIR PHYSICAL EQUIVALENT,  
WHETHER THOSE THOUGHTS ARE VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARY.  
Thought impulses which are picked up through the ether, by mere chance
