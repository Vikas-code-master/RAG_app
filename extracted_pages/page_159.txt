Persistence is a state of mind, therefore it can be cultivated. Like all states of  
mind, persistence is based upon definite causes, among them these:—
a. DEFINITENESS OF PURPOSE. Knowing what one wants  
is the first and, perhaps, the most important step toward the  
development of persistence. A strong motive forces one to  
surmount many difficulties. 
b. DESIRE. It is comparatively easy to acquire and to  
maintain persistence in pursuing the object of intense desire. 
c. SELF-RELIANCE. Belief in one's ability to carry out a plan  
encourages one to follow the plan through with persistence. (Self-
reliance can be developed through the principle described in the  
chapter on auto-suggestion). 
d. DEFINITENESS OF PLANS. Organized plans, even  
though they may be weak and entirely impractical, encourage  
persistence.
e. ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE. Knowing that one's plans are  
sound, based upon experience or observation, encourages  
persistence; "guessing" instead of "knowing" destroys persistence.
f. CO-OPERATION. Sympathy, understanding, and  
harmonious cooperation with others tend to develop persistence. 
g. WILL-POWER. The habit of concentrating one's thoughts  
upon the building of plans for the attainment of a definite 164 164  
Page 165 166 165 purpose, leads to persistence.
h. HABIT. Persistence is the direct result of habit. The mind  
absorbs and becomes a part of the daily experiences upon which it  
feeds. Fear, the worst of all enemies, can be effectively cured by 
forced repetition of acts of courage . Everyone who has seen active  
service in war knows this.
